  The feature-based shift-reduce constituent parsers now has become one of the state-of-the-art parsing systems due to their efficiency. But there still remains a problem: most of the popular shift-reduce constituency parsers relied on inexact search which cannot guarantee the exactness. In this paper, we will propose a novel idea which based on A* algorithm to perform an exact search for shift-reduce constituent parsing. An exact search will lead to an optimal model for global training of shift-reduce parser and gives a better performance than inexact search. The final experiments has shown that our parser has outperformed inexact search with the same feature set in terms of F-score and can get a comparable accuracies to the previous state-of-the-art parsers.
