\section{Discussion}
 	It is clearly to see that inexact search cannot exploit the potential of such feature template like exact one. In the future, we will study how to design a good A* parser (hierarchical A* with reduced-constituent approach) which can apply arbitrary feature sets without taking too much parsing time.
