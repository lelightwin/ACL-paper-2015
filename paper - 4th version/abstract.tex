	The approach of global discriminative shift-reduce parsing is quite successful, giving 	state-of-the-art performance both for constituency and dependency parsing problem, but most of existing parsers rely on some approximations such as beam search, which discards the optimality. In this paper, we explain how exact search become possible for constituency shift-reduce parsing and explore the effect of optimality empirically. This is the first work on exact search for shift-reduce parsing in a global discriminative setting. The key components of our system are the new feature templates to reduce the time complexity and several A* heuristics for keeping a tractable runtime. Experiments on the standard Penn Treebank verifies the effectiveness of exact search: our new features is not as strong as richer features with the same beam size, but with A* search, it produces F-score of 91.1\% that other beam-based systems cannot reach even with very large beam sizes.
