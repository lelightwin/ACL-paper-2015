\section{Experiment}
	Describes experimental settings:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item We use Stanford PoS tagger to produce input for parsing.
		\item Section 22 for experiments on effectiveness of A* and span features. Section 23 for the final results comparing to the others.
		\item Configuration of computer which runs the experiments.
	\end{itemize}

	\input{Figures/SpeedAndAccuracyComparison1.tex}
\subsection{Speed and Accuracy Comparison}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Comparing search quality between difference A* heuristic on span features. (Figure \ref{devExFig1})
		\item Comparing search quality between A* parser with beam search parser with different beam size on span features. (Figure \ref{devExFig2})
		\item Total performance comparison between our A* parser with beam search on span features and Zhang's baseline in both accuracy and speed.
	\end{itemize}

\subsection{Final Results}
	The results of final experiment to show that our parser can achieve a state-of-the-art performance with only simplified feature template.
